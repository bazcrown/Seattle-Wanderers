                <p>Hello and Welcome to our site! We are Team 1 of The Art of Web Design at SeattleU</p>
                <p>This site is a group project by Michael, Marc, J Guadalupe, Barbara, and Will. We are making a activities site for things to do in Seattle, Washington.</p>
                <p>Our goal for this project is to create a functional website while working on our web design skill set and practicing soft skills for working as a team.</p>
                <p>We value accessability and usability in our web design across different devices and platforms. One of our goals is to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience and to accomodate those with disabilities.</p>
                <p>Put team image here later.</p>

                            Hi my name is Michael Moore and I was happy to work as a developer on this site. 
                            Our goal was to build a website that would answer the question: "What should I do this weekend?" 
                            We put a lot of work into coming up with some great events for you to choose from.

                            Hi! My name is Barbara Makowski and I am third year computer science and finance double degree student at Seattle University. My part in this project was working on the food page and home page. The goal was to help our site users discover great places to eat around Seattle as well as beautify the first page the user sees when they check out our project. I also took lead in making sure our task board was up to date and everything was organized, so that the team knew what had to be done, what was done, and what our reach goals were.

                        Hello! My name is J Guadalupe Andrade but I just go by Jose. I am a third year Computer Science major at Seattle University. My part in this project was to help create the contact us page and allow for the page to be both functionally and aesthetically pleasing. The goal was to have it be straightforward while also making it a bit complex by adding functionality that would allow the user to have a way of contacting us directly without having to go to another website. To do this I added a form that could be filled out and submitted directly to us.

                        I'm Marc Brophy, 4th year computer science Major with a specialization in business. My part of the project was sourcing data from existing APIs, and hosting our backend services using Amazon Web Services. This would allow us to hold a separate space to update and hold information without having to re-upload our html files.

I was responsible for creating and styling the coffee page and the about us page. The purpose of the coffee page is to share our passion for coffee, and we hope that you have an opportunity to visit all of the amazing places to visit in Seattle for coffee.
