            <h2>Archipelago</h2>
            <h5>Filipino, Tasting Menu</h5>
            <div><img src="FoodJPGs/archipelago.png" alt="Archipelago"></div>
            <p>5607 Rainier Avenue South, Seattle; no phone; <a href="https://www.archipelagoseattle.com">archipelagoseattle.com</a></p>
            <p>
                It’s rare for the chef to check in with diners at the end of the tasting menu and make sure 
                they’re feeling full, but Archipelago isn’t like any other tasting. A puff of pan de sal pulls 
                apart effortlessly, filling the air with a sweet, buttery perfume. Burning pine needles and the 
                rich, muscly scent of shrimp paste waft over from the open kitchen. Cooks walk around with a 
                tray of sliced rib-eye steak, offering seconds. You could easily get lost in the deliciousness 
                of the modern Filipino food, but Aaron Verzosa and Amber Manuguid do more than send out excellent 
                food. They tell complicated, expansive stories about the Pacific Northwest and the many ways that 
                Filipino immigrants have shaped it, using words, pictures and even some unexpected dance moves 
                behind the pass.

            <p>
                Capitol Hill neighbors know that chef Stuart Lane runs the menu at Artusi which offers four splendid 
                handmade pastas per night. The windowed corner space here feels buzzy and urbane, and for $32, you 
                can get every lovely appetizer on the menu — even the hazelnuts, candied in muscovado sugar with 
                Controne chile and fennel pollen, are especially tasty. The screaming dinner deal on Sunday and Monday 
                — two pastas and a bottle of wine for $45 — is hard to beat.</p>

                Seattle has many pho options — and you may end up in a real argument if you try to declare a best 
                — but the phở hà nội style here is superlative. Made with marrow bones from organic, grass-fed 
                cattle, the broth is simmered for 24 hours and has a fortifying balance of beefy, gingery flavors, 
                spiked with heat from pickled bird’s-eye chiles. The imperial rolls will spoil you for any others, 
                with a blistered, shattering fried rice-paper wrapping. And the cocktail menu, inflected with 
                tropical notes like tamarind, pineapple and orgeat, is impressive without being self-serious. Which 
                is nice when the Vietnamese chicken wings pair so well with, say, a Wenatchee sling, and the Capitol 
                Hill location is open until midnight.

            <h2>Bar del Corso</h2>
            <h5>Italian</h5>
            <div><img src="FoodJPGs/bardelcorso.png" alt="Bar del Corso"></div>
            <p>3057 Beacon Avenue South, Seattle; 206-395-2069; <a href="https://www.bardelcorso.com">bardelcorso.com</a></p>
            <p>
                Now more than 10 years old, this Pacific Northwest trattoria has become an anchor for the Beacon Hill 
                neighborhood. The Neapolitan pizzas are canonical; cooked in an Italian-built wood-fired oven, they 
                are pillowy-crusted and kissed with an appropriate char. It’s common to see the chef Jerry Corso, who 
                owns the restaurant with his wife, Gina Tolentino Corso, hovering near the mouth of the oven and 
                expertly topping pies as they come out. In addition to standing options like margherita and salame 
                piccante, daily topping specials may include seasonal offerings like morels and spring onions. Pizza 
                is the star here, but Mr. Corso spent time running the kitchen at the acclaimed Obelisk in Washington, 
                D.C., so the supporting cast of dishes like grilled octopus with corona bean and ’nduja are equally 
                adept.

            <h2>Bateau</h2>
            <h5>Steakhouse</h5>
            <div><img src="FoodJPGs/bateau.png" alt="Bateau"></div>
            <p>S1040 East Union Street, Seattle; 206-900-8699; <a href="https://restaurantbateau.com">restaurantbateau.com</a></p>
            <p>
                Bateau is like no other steakhouse in the United States. While it’s possible to run up an expense-account
                -worthy tab and get a bracing martini, there are no dark wood appointments, no commodious booths. Instead, 
                the chef Renee Erickson has taken the Pacific Northwest sensibilities of her Sea Creatures restaurant 
                group and channeled them through this carnivorous counterpoint. There is a big chalkboard listing the 
                day’s available steaks — when they run out of a cut, it’s erased — and less popular but no less delicious 
                choices like the culotte and rump cap are fixtures. That’s because the restaurant uses as much of the 
                animal as possible, and a cow carries only so many rib-eyes. In that same spirit, sides like smoked-and-
                spiced shank jerky and beef liver mousse optimize off-cuts and other bovine ingredients.

            <p>
                One of America’s great restaurants, Canlis has managed to both change with the culinary times and keep 
                what has made it beloved for 73 years — the striking midcentury dining room overlooking Lake Union, and 
                the famously attentive service. Aisha Ibrahim, the current executive chef, came with a résumé stacked 
                with global standouts like Manresa in California and Azurmendi in Spain. Her menu is focused and luxurious. 
                Gorgeous presentations of dishes like halibut with geoduck and a sauce of kasu butter and peas are 
                matched by the depth and range of flavors on the plate. The lacquered and roasted mushroom preparation 
                will have you wondering why anyone bothers to serve them any other way. The magisterial wine list, 
                overseen by Linda Milagros Violago, runs to 2,600 selections.

            <h2>The Chicken Supply</h2>
            <h5>Fried Chicken, Filipino</h5>
            <div><img src="FoodJPGs/chickensupply.png" alt="The Chicken Supply"></div>
            <p>7410 Greenwood Avenue North, Seattle; 206-257-4460; <a href="https://www.thechickensupply.com">thechickensupply.com</a></p>
            <p>
                This diminutive spot supplies its namesake bird over-the-counter, fried in a slightly puffy, prodigiously 
                crackly crust. Thighs, drumsticks and wings are sold by the piece, but the Stick is the thing. Eight 
                inches of sizable breast-meat hunks, marinated for 12 hours for juiciness, the Stick offers more surface 
                area, which means more golden-brown crispiness. It must be eaten as soon as it’s no longer mouth-searingly 
                hot, whether at the Chicken Supply’s handful of tables, in the car or walking around the surrounding 
                Phinney Ridge neighborhood. Part of the coating’s magic is a mix of four starches — all of which are 
                gluten-free, as is the entirety of the chef and co-owner Paolo Campbell’s menu of Filipino-leaning sides. 
                Don’t miss the tricolor pancit, or the single dessert, a fantastic butter mochi.

            <p>
                The vibes at Communion are warm and welcoming, and it’s not unusual to strike up a conversation with 
                the table next to yours while snacking on some grilled okra, or to be invited to an art opening by a 
                stranger at the bar. The menu changes seasonally, but a dish like the neck-bone stew will, at least 
                for a few minutes, make chatting impossible. It’s so delicious, it requires all of your attention — 
                the crisp-edged strands of smoky meat, the big, tender lima beans and the deeply flavored broth. But 
                every dish has a certain pull, from the catfish and grits to the local clams in coconut milk. Kristi 
                Brown, who ran a catering company before opening her own restaurant, doesn’t miss.

                This International District spot describes itself as “mukokuseki,” a Japanese term that roughly 
                translates to “stateless,” but more specifically means not having the distinctive features of any 
                particular ethnicity. Which tracks. The menu is constantly changing, but don’t be surprised to see 
                dishes like the Loco Moco Scotch Egg, a formidable version of that classic English pub snack that 
                channels Hawaii, complete with a side of mac salad, by way of Hackney. Or the Piggy Parm Katsu Sando, 
                which tops a breaded fried pork loin with spaghetti marinara, enrobes them both in mozzarella cheese 
                and sandwiches the lot between pieces of shokupan garlic bread. It’s all hearty enough to clad your 
                stomach for an evening spent with the extensive selection of shochu highballs on the cocktail list.

                The room is tiny — just 6 feet 4 inches wide, with 12 seats — but the husband-and-wife team Evan 
                Leichtling and Meghna Prakash maximize every square inch. Ms. Prakash runs the front of the house and 
                assembles the distinctive wine list. Mr. Leichtling — who has cooked at the three-Michelin-starred 
                Akelarre in San Sebastián, Spain — holds sway in the diminutive kitchen. Their combined sensibility 
                lends dinners the raucous feel of a Lyonnaise bouchon, with an urban edge. The dishes are nose-to-tail 
                accented with Pacific Northwest ingredients — braised tripe with morels and ñora peppers; gooseneck 
                barnacles with charred scallion aioli; fried pig head with preserved cherries and Walla Walla onions. 
                And they will tantalizingly disappear from the chalkboard menu as the night goes on.
